In addition to `PSET` saves, there is an additional way to save your data in the `META` menu. The first option in this menu allows you to toggle to load the last saved PSET when starting. This is useful to avoid having to `PSET > load` constantly when working on a piece.

The other two options are for creating or opening "archives". An "archive" is a zip-file that stores a self-contained version of the current patch - samples included. These archives can be shared between norns and they recapitulate 100% of the current state of *zxcvbn* without having to worry about having sample files in the right places. To share archives, you can just copy an archive from the `data/zxcvbn/archives` folder into someone else's folder. Then you can load it with `load archive` option. After loading an archive, you should save it as a `PSET` if you want to later open it from the `PSET` menu.
